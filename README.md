### Who I am

I am a programmer, a manager, and an entrepreneur. Over my career, I founded or co-founded Degel Software, 2AM Games, and Vringo.

I've worked at all levels in these companies, but my true passion is using the best tools to create the best tools. For me, this usually means programming, but I also enjoy woodworking, cooking, and other creative skills.

Currently, most of my work is for clients, and is mostly in JavaScript or -- all too often -- in Google Docs or meetings.  But, my current favorite langauge is Clojure, which combines the best ideas from Lisp, Functional Programming, and the giant JVM and JavaScript ecosystems.
